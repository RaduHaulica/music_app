# Music filter

Takes a list of songs and enables filtering by track name, artist, genre etc.

The goal is to have a lists of nice songs to play at impromptu parties without having to burden your brain with actually remembering any songs of an appropriate genre.

End goal is to do it without having to manually manage youtube while still keeping authoritarian control over what is played. No surprises. No unvetted or subversive tracks. Only party-approved bangers.

## Dev notes

List is hardcoded for now, parsed into appropriate objects.

Filtering is now live on providing input.

TODO: Tags make filtering by genre easier.
